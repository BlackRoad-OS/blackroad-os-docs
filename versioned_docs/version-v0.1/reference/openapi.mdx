The HTTP surface area for BlackRoad OS is defined in `blackroad-os-api`. The spec is pulled at build time and rendered with Redoc.

- Rendered spec is available at `/reference/openapi` in the navigation
- Source file: `static/api/openapi.yaml` (populated via `npm run fetch:openapi`)

Use the Reference navigation to open the rendered spec.
