The agent catalog is generated from `agent-catalog/agents.yaml` during the docs build. Each agent page lists capabilities, approvals, inputs, and evidence expectations so operators know how to deploy it safely.

- **Where to edit:** Update `agent-catalog/agents.yaml` and rerun `yarn build:catalog`.
- **Output:** MDX pages in `docs/agents/` and a Mermaid org chart in `docs/org-chart.mmd`.
- **Search:** Agent IDs, pack names, and role keywords are added to Algolia metadata for discovery.

Use the generated catalog to align runtime policy, access, and release notes across the organization.
