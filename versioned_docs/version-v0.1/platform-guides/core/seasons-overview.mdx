Seasons describe the architecture phases BlackRoad OS moves through. They keep every repository aligned on the same goals and ensure the infra season tracker can reflect progress across codebases.

## How Seasons work
- A **Season** captures a thematic milestone with clear goals, expected changes to the stack, and cross-repo implications.
- Season checkpoints are mirrored in `blackroad-os-infra` (environment definitions, DNS, deployment plans) and should be referenced before landing any major change.
- Each repo should note which Season its default branch targets; unfinished work can live behind flags or feature branches.

## Season snapshots
- **Season 0–1: Genesis / OS Skeleton** — establish PS-SHA∞ identity types, core Result helpers, initial Operator runtime, and minimal API to expose health.
- **Season 2: Multi-repo cohesion (current)** — align Core, Operator, API, Prism Console, Infra, and Docs with shared language and event shapes; stand up RoadChain journaling.
- **Season 3: Intelligence Layer** — expand agent registry (Atlas, Lucidia), richer verification jobs, and tighter Prism insights for agents and finance.
- **Season 4+: Ecosystem** — public RoadChain visibility, wallets, demos/worlds, and broader partner integrations.

When in doubt, check the Season tracker in `blackroad-os-infra` and mirror the labels here so future contributors and agents know the current operating context.
