Events are the connective tissue of BlackRoad OS. They describe what happened, when, and which identities were involved. RoadChain turns those events into an auditable, hash-linked journal.

## DomainEvents
- Emitted by the Operator runtime whenever jobs or agents change state.
- Carry references to agents, jobs, PS-SHA∞ anchors, and contextual metadata.
- Intended for both real-time consumption (Prism dashboards) and long-term audit.

## Journal entries
- Every DomainEvent is persisted as a `JournalEntry` with timestamps and signatures.
- Journal entries are immutable; corrections are additive via new events, not edits.

## RoadChain blocks
- RoadChain groups journal entries into ordered blocks.
- Each block is hash-linked to the previous one for tamper evidence.
- Blocks can be referenced in incident reports, finance audits, or investor updates to prove lineage of actions.

## How Prism will visualize it
- **Events feed** — chronological list with filters for agent, job, severity, or identity.
- **RoadChain explorer** — block-level view showing grouped journal entries, hashes, and linked metadata.
- **Tracebacks** — follow a job through events to the block where it was sealed.

Keep the event schema tight and reuse core types so every surface (Operator logs, API responses, Prism, future wallets) can rely on the same vocabulary.
