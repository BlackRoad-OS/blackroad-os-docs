Use this checklist to spin up the BlackRoad OS stack locally. It assumes you cloned the repositories into a common directory and have Node.js 20+, npm or pnpm, git, and Docker available.

## Setup steps

1. Clone the repos you need: `blackroad-os-core`, `blackroad-os-operator`, `blackroad-os-api`, `blackroad-os-prism-console`, `blackroad-os-web`, and this docs repo.
2. Install dependencies in each repo (`npm install` or `pnpm install`). Keep versions aligned with the `.nvmrc` or `engines` fields if present.
3. If `blackroad-os-core` provides a runtime, start it or ensure its libraries are built for downstream consumers.
4. Start the operator to host agents. Finance agents can run in stub mode until you hook them to live data sources.
5. Launch the API, typically binding to a port in the 4000–5000 range. Load any required environment variables (database URIs, secrets, base URLs).
6. Run Prism Console with `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` pointing to your API instance. Visit `/dashboard` or `/finance` to confirm connectivity.
7. Optionally run the Web app for the marketing experience and to verify documentation links.
8. Run this docs site via `npm run start` to keep guidance close at hand.

## Stubbing dependencies

Not every integration must be live during local development. Use mock data for bank feeds, sandbox queues for events, and stub implementations of PS-SHA∞ when cryptographic anchoring is not necessary. Document your choices in pull requests so other contributors understand the assumptions.

## Next steps

When comfortable, explore [Extending Agents](/platform/api/extending-agents) to add new capabilities. Cross-reference environment settings in [Infra Environments](/platform/operator/environments) before deploying anything beyond dev, and consult [Deployments & Runbooks](/platform/operator/deployments-and-runbooks) for rollout discipline.
