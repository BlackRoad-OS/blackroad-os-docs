Agents are the workers inside BlackRoad OS. Each agent is registered in Operator, anchored with PS-SHA∞ identity data, and consumes jobs through a shared contract defined in `blackroad-os-core`.

## What makes an agent
- **Identity** — PS-SHA∞ anchor ties the agent to an auditable worldline.
- **Metadata** — capabilities, version, and contact points (e.g., supported job kinds).
- **State** — lifecycle data surfaced to Prism and API (ready, busy, degraded, disabled).
- **Context** — `AgentContext` carries configuration, environment handles, and journal access for emitting events.

## Atlas (today)
- Ops-aware assistant focused on running and debugging the OS itself.
- Can inspect agents, jobs, and environment wiring; ideal for incident support and deployment validation.
- Emits DomainEvents for every action so the RoadChain trail stays intact.

## Future agents (examples)
- **Lucidia** — exploratory or research-heavy agent.
- **Finance agents** — ledgering, forecasting, treasury actions.
- **Infra agents** — provisioning or DNS updates under strict guardrails.

## Registration and surfacing
- Agents register with Operator, which keeps the registry exposed at `/internal/agents` and to the API layer.
- Jobs target agents by ID or capability; Operator enforces lifecycle transitions and emits events on every change.
- Prism renders agent state directly from the API, so agents should keep metadata and health signals current.

If you are building a new agent, start with the core types, emit DomainEvents consistently, and ensure PS-SHA∞ anchors are present so RoadChain can prove the agent’s lineage.
