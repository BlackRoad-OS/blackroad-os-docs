BlackRoad OS is an orchestration operating system that connects identity, truth, runtime, and interfaces into one verifiable loop. Each layer is explicit so operators, developers, partners, and future agents can see where a capability belongs and how evidence is captured.

## Layers at a glance
- **Identity layer** — PS-SHA∞ anchors tie people, agents, and assets to stable worldlines.
- **Truth layer** — verification jobs, truth states, and minority reports produce a defendable view of reality.
- **Runtime layer** — `blackroad-os-operator` runs agents (Atlas and future peers), jobs, and emits DomainEvents; `blackroad-os-api` exposes a stable HTTP surface for everything outside the runtime.
- **Interface layer** — Prism Console for operators, `blackroad-os-web` for the public shell, and future inbox/roadmail surfaces.
- **Infra layer** — DNS, environments, deployment pipelines, and observability defined in `blackroad-os-infra`.
- **Audit layer** — RoadChain journal blocks hash-link the event stream for tamper-evident history.

### Flow of work
```
Text / task → Operator → Agent(s) → DomainEvents → Journal entries → RoadChain blocks → Prism & Web
```

1. A prompt, task, or webhook enters the system.
2. Operator routes it to one or more agents, each anchored by PS-SHA∞ identities.
3. Agents execute jobs, emit DomainEvents, and store journal entries.
4. RoadChain groups journal entries into hash-linked blocks for auditability.
5. Prism Console and the public web surfaces visualize state, finance, and evidence.

## How to read this layer cake
- Start with the [Stack Map](./stack-map) to see the repositories and what layer they belong to.
- Review [Seasons Overview](./seasons) to understand the roadmap and current phase.
- Operators should continue to the [Prism Console](/platform/prism-console/overview) and [Infra Guide](/platform/operator/infra-guide).
- Developers should read [Core Primitives](/platform/core/primitives) and [API Overview](/platform/api/overview) next.
