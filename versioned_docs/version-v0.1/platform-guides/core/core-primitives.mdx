`blackroad-os-core` holds the shared types and helpers that every other repository uses. Keep these primitives stable: they shape how agents, jobs, events, and truth states are expressed everywhere else.

## Result helpers
- `Result<T, E>` — functional success/error envelope.
- `ok(value)` — wrap a success value.
- `err(error)` — wrap an error while preserving type information.

## Identity
- `PsShaInfinity` — identity anchor that binds an entity to a verifiable worldline.
- `IdentityAnchor` — concrete anchor instance containing the PS-SHA∞ hash and metadata.
- `IdentityKind` — enum describing whether the anchor is a human, agent, asset, or service.

## Truth pipeline
- `TextSnapshot` — immutable text input captured for verification.
- `VerificationJob` — request to assess a snapshot; typically executed by an agent like Atlas.
- `AgentAssessment` — agent-produced judgment about the snapshot.
- `TruthState` — aggregated result (affirmed, disputed, retracted) plus minority reports.

## Events & journaling
- `DomainEvent` — canonical event wrapper for runtime transitions and job outcomes.
- `JournalEntry` — persisted record of an event, ready to be grouped into RoadChain blocks.
- `RoadChainBlock` — hash-linked bundle of journal entries with block metadata for audit.

## Agents & jobs
- `Agent`, `AgentContext`, `AgentMetadata`, `AgentState` — shape how agents are registered, invoked, and tracked.
- `Job`, `JobStatus` — lifecycle states for work items.
- Lifecycle helpers such as `startJob`, `completeJob`, and `failJob` enforce consistent transitions and event emission.

Use these primitives instead of ad-hoc types so Prism, API, Operator, and future agents (including Atlas and Lucidia) see the same worldview.
