DNS is managed through Cloudflare with a consistent pattern per environment. Each service receives a predictable subdomain so operators, agents, and external users know where to reach it. Terraform modules in `blackroad-os-infra` own zone records, TLS settings, and any required tunnels.

## Base strategy

- Root zones exist for production and environment-specific subdomains (e.g., `blackroad.systems`, `dev.blackroad.systems`, `stg.blackroad.systems`).
- Service records follow a consistent pattern, typically `<service>.<env>.blackroad.systems`.
- Cloudflare handles TLS termination and security policies, with origin servers pinned to known IPs or load balancers.

## Adding a new service

1. Define the DNS record in the `dns` module within `blackroad-os-infra`, specifying the environment and target.
2. Associate the record with the appropriate service module so that infrastructure and DNS changes roll out together.
3. Apply the Terraform changes for the desired environment after peer review and required approvals.
4. Validate propagation and health checks before advertising the new endpoint to agents or users.

Networking relies on consistent CIDR allocations and security groups defined in infra modules. Coordinate with the infra team when introducing new ingress/egress paths or when agents need to reach sensitive systems.
