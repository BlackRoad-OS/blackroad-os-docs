Prism Console is the operator-facing cockpit for BlackRoad OS. It brings system status, agent state, finance visibility, and the RoadChain event stream into one UI so an orchestrator can act quickly and with evidence.

## What Prism Console covers
- **Dashboard** — high-level health, pending jobs, recent truth state changes, and alerts from the Operator runtime.
- **Agents** — registry view of Atlas and future agents, including PS-SHA∞ anchors, current jobs, and state transitions.
- **Finance** — wallet/treasury snapshot, ROI views, and agent cost attribution where available.
- **Events / RoadChain Explorer** — chronological DomainEvents, journal entries, and RoadChain blocks with search and filters.
- **Future pages** — Inbox/RoadMail, Hardware/Nodes, and Operator Chat are planned as the runtime expands.

## How it talks to the API
Prism is a Next.js app that reads from `blackroad-os-api`. Configure the base URL via:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000
```

Typical endpoints consumed:
- `GET /api/v1/system/overview`
- `GET /api/v1/agents`
- `GET /api/v1/agents/:id`
- `GET /api/v1/finance/snapshot`
- `GET /api/v1/events`
- `GET /api/v1/roadchain/blocks`

## Running locally
1. Start `blackroad-os-api` (or point at a deployed instance) and ensure CORS is configured for the console host.
2. Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` to the API origin.
3. Run `npm install && npm run dev` inside `blackroad-os-prism-console`.
4. Log in or load the dashboard; confirm the agents and finance panels populate.

## Reading the dashboards
- Treat the **Dashboard** as your pulse: spikes in failed jobs or truth retractions should drive investigation.
- Use **Agents** to verify Atlas (or others) are registered and emitting events; cross-check IDs against PS-SHA∞ anchors.
- The **Finance** tab is the bridge between operations and ROI; if numbers look wrong, check the event stream for missing ledger entries.
- The **Events / RoadChain Explorer** is the audit trail. When filing incidents or compliance reports, capture block references instead of screenshots alone.
