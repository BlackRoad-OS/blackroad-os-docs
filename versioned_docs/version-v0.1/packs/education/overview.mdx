The Education pack targets learning, onboarding, and knowledge-ops workflows. Use it as a template for launching new packs that expose curated agents and policies.

## Included capabilities

- Lesson planning and content review agents tailored for compliance-sensitive orgs.
- Rubrics that translate PS-SHA∞ anchored observations into course-level evidence.
- Prism Console dashboards focused on learner outcomes and instructor interventions.

## Adding new education personas

1. Add agent entries to `agent-catalog/agents.yaml` with `pack: education`.
2. Run `yarn build:catalog` to generate MDX pages under `docs/agents/`.
3. Link the generated pages from this pack overview or downstream playbooks.

## Launch checklist

- Validate integration against `blackroad-os-api` using the Reference section.
- Confirm audit signals flow into PS-SHA∞ for each learning job.
- Publish a short announcement in the Packs nav so operators know what changed.
