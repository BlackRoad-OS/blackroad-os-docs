BlackRoad OS is built for organizations that operate in regulated industries. The platform emphasizes clear journaling, explicit human approval gates, and separation of duties so automation can coexist with oversight. This document is informational and does not constitute legal advice.

## Principles

- **Auditability:** Every material action can produce a PS-SHA∞ journal entry that records who initiated it, what changed, and when.
- **Human-in-the-loop:** Critical workflows include escalation paths to designated approvers (e.g., Cecilia) before irreversible steps execute.
- **Separation of duties:** Agents specialize by domain, reducing the blast radius of mistakes and making controls easier to reason about.

## Why it matters

Regulated stakeholders such as CFOs, General Counsels, and Chief Compliance Officers need confidence that AI-driven automation will not bypass controls. BlackRoad OS keeps the evidence trail and approval flow visible so auditors can trace decisions without reverse-engineering code paths.

## Next steps

Dive into [Audit & Journaling](/governance-policy/audit-and-journaling) for the cryptographic story or explore the [Finance Layer](/packs/finance/finance-layer) to see how policies surface in day-to-day workflows. TODO: add mappings to specific regulations as implementations mature.
