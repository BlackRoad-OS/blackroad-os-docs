BlackRoad OS treats incidents as shared responsibilities between agents and humans. Automation accelerates detection and containment, while humans provide judgment and regulatory context. This page outlines the flow and points you to infra runbooks for detailed procedures.

## Detection

Metrics, health checks, and future alerting pipelines feed into the operator and Prism Console. Agents can emit anomaly events when they detect policy violations or missing data.

### Alert catalogue and thresholds

| Category | Example trigger | Default threshold | First responder |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Availability | Consecutive failed health checks for an agent or orchestrator | 3 failures within 10 minutes | Platform on-call |
| Compliance | Action attempted without a required approval or missing journal signature | 1 event | Governance lead |
| Data quality | Ledger drift between RoadChain and finance layer projections | >0.1% variance over 15 minutes | Finance SRE |
| Security | Suspicious capability escalation or role assumption | 1 event from PS-SHA∞ verifier | Security on-call |

Thresholds are defined in `blackroad-os-infra/runbooks/alerts.yaml` and surfaced in the Prism Console so operators can tune them per environment. Each alert is linked to a mitigation playbook that includes rollback steps and journaling requirements. If you need to add a new alert type, open a governance ticket with the proposed trigger, responder, and evidence captured for audits.

## Triage

Operators review events and journal entries to reconstruct timelines. Determine scope (which agents, which environments), identify blast radius, and decide whether to pause automations. Coordination between the API and operator ensures actions are reversible and traceable.

## Response

Common responses include rolling back a deployment, disabling a capability, or applying configuration overrides. Use PS-SHA∞ journaling to record every step, including who approved the action. Follow environment-specific rollback steps from `blackroad-os-infra/runbooks` and confirm health checks before restoring normal operations.

## Postmortem

After stabilization, capture a postmortem that includes timeline, root causes, and prevention steps. Link journal entries and event IDs so auditors can replay the sequence. Update runbooks and agent policies to prevent recurrence, and communicate findings to stakeholders who rely on the [Finance Layer](/packs/finance/finance-layer) or other critical workflows.
