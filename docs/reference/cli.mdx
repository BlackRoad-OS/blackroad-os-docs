Use the CLI to scaffold agents, inspect RoadChain entries, and interact with Operator without opening the console. Commands assume you have Node 20+ and the repo cloned locally.

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start docs locally
npm run start
```

## Common commands

- `yarn build` — Builds the docs with link checking enabled.
- `yarn build:catalog` — Regenerates agent docs from `agent-catalog/agents.yaml`.
- `yarn fetch:openapi` — Pulls the latest OpenAPI spec into `static/api/openapi.yaml`.
- `yarn start` — Launches the local Docusaurus dev server.

## Environment variables

- `ALGOLIA_APP_ID` and `ALGOLIA_API_KEY` power DocSearch.
- `DOCS_PREVIEW_URL` is emitted by CI for PR comments.
- `OPENAPI_SOURCE` can override the default `blackroad-os-api` spec source.

## Troubleshooting

If a command fails, clear caches with `npm run clean` and rerun. For dependency issues, remove `node_modules` and reinstall with Node 20.
