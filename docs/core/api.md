# Core API guide

Outline the critical endpoints, authentication model, and versioning expectations for the Core API. Link to OpenAPI/Swagger docs when available.

- Authentication: JWT or service tokens issued by the Core platform.
- Key flows: tenant provisioning, identity management, agent registration, and observability hooks.
- Environments: prefer URLs sourced from `CORE_API_URL` in `src/config/docsConfig.js`.

TODO: Add sample requests and error envelopes per endpoint family.
