BlackRoad OS is an orchestration operating system that lets a single human orchestrator direct agents and services with verifiable evidence. It anchors work to PS-SHA∞ identities, runs verification pipelines for truth states, journals everything through RoadChain, and surfaces system health through Prism Console and the public web shell. The platform lives across multiple repositories but speaks one architectural language.

This hub participates in the shared **"BlackRoad OS - Master Orchestration"** project and is the canonical place to understand how the stack fits together, how to operate it, and why it exists.

## Choose your path

### Operate the OS
- [Prism Console](ops/prism-console) — cockpit for system status, agents, finance, and events.
- [Infra Guide](ops/infra-guide) — how environments, DNS, and deployments hang together.
- [Operator Runtime](ops/operator-runtime) — how agents run and emit events.

### Build on the OS
- [Core Primitives](dev/core-primitives) — domain models, identities, truth pipeline, and jobs.
- [API Overview](dev/api-overview) — HTTP surface exposed by `blackroad-os-api`.
- [Agents: Atlas and Friends](dev/agents-atlas-and-friends) — how agents register, identify, and report state.
- [Events and RoadChain](dev/events-and-roadchain) — journaling, blocks, and how the explorer will work.

### Understand the Why
- [Pain Points Summary](business/pain-points) — problems BlackRoad OS is built to solve.
- [Value Proposition](business/value-proposition) — benefits for creators, teams, and partners.
- [Seasons Overview](overview/seasons) — how the roadmap is structured.

## Quick orientation
- [BlackRoad OS Overview](overview/blackroad-os-overview) — the layered picture from identity to interface.
- [Stack Map](overview/stack-map) — repositories mapped to layers and status.
- [Getting Started](getting-started) — run the docs locally and clone the stack.

BlackRoad OS is designed to stay honest about its current state. Pages mark components as planned, alpha, or in-flight so operators, developers, and partners know where to invest. Feedback and contributions are welcome—iterate with small, linked docs instead of monolithic walls of text.
