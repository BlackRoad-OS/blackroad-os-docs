The Web UI delivers customer-facing experiences and leans on the core backend for data and auth. It is optimized for CDN delivery through Cloudflare.

## Composition
- Framework: Next.js (App Router) with shared design system
- Data: GraphQL/REST calls to core backend
- Auth: JWT/cookie sessions issued by core

> TODO: Link to the design system tokens and component library once published.
