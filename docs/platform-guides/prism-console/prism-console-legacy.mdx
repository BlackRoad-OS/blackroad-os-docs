# Prism Console

Prism Console is the operator-facing UI for BlackRoad OS. It surfaces agent health, finance workflows, and event streams so humans can supervise automation. The console connects to `blackroad-os-api` and relies on that service for data freshness and authorization.

## Pages

- **Dashboard:** High-level status across agents, environments, and active tasks.
- **Agents:** Inventory of agents and capabilities, including health signals and recent activity.
- **Finance:** Views tailored for the finance layer—close progress, ledger snapshots, and treasury positions.
- **Events:** Stream of recent events and journal entries to trace actions and debug issues.

## Configuration

Set `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` to the API endpoint for your environment before starting the console. For local development, point it at the API port you started from [Local Development](/platform/core/local-development). Ensure CORS and auth settings on the API side permit console access.

## Usage

Start the API and operator, then run Prism Console. Navigate to `/dashboard` for overall health or `/finance` to check the finance agents. Use event views to confirm that PS-SHA∞ journal entries are flowing as expected. TODO: add screenshots once the UI stabilizes.
