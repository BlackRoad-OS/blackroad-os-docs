Infrastructure definitions live in `blackroad-os-infra`. This guide orients operators to the core references rather than duplicating them here.

## Where to look
- **Service registry** — canonical list of services, ports, and dependencies. Use it to align `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`, API origins, and Operator endpoints.
- **Environment config** — dev/staging/prod settings, secrets management approach, and expected DNS names per environment.
- **DNS blueprint** — Cloudflare/registrar mappings and how services are exposed externally.
- **Deployment runbooks** — Railway or other deployment steps, rollback procedures, and incident checklists.
- **Season tracker** — authoritative source for which repositories are in which Season.

## How this repo uses infra
- Docs are static and built with Docusaurus, but they should mirror environment naming and base URLs used across the stack.
- When adding examples that reference services, match the ports and hostnames from the service registry to avoid drift.
- Incidents or outages should point to RoadChain blocks or event IDs plus the runbooks stored in `blackroad-os-infra`.

Treat infra as shared contract: changes there should ripple into Prism configuration, API origins, and any URLs mentioned in these docs.
