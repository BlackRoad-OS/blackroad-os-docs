# Operator Playbooks

> TODO: Flesh out runbooks for console operators, incident response, and release management.
>
> This section should eventually include:
> - **Runbooks:** standard operating procedures for on-call and console operators.
> - **Playbooks:** repeatable steps for common production tasks (failover, migrations, cache warm-ups).
> - **Dashboards & alerts:** links to observability dashboards and alert routing.
> - **Run readiness:** preflight checklists for deploys and maintenance windows.

This stub anchors the `operator/` section in navigation so the structure stays stable while content is authored.
