BlackRoad OS is the cohesive operating system for orchestrating BlackRoad products across APIs, web UI, the Prism Console, and agent runtimes. It aligns platform capabilities, observability, and operational conventions so every surface ships together.

## Why this handbook exists
- Create a single front door for engineers, operators, and partners.
- Standardize patterns (environment variables, deployments, observability) across repos.
- Document how the console, agents, core backend, and web experience interact.

## Scope
This site covers architecture, setup, deployment flows, and glossary terms across the BlackRoad stack. Each area links to its owning repository for source-of-truth code and workflows.
