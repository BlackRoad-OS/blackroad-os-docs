BlackRoad OS should feel like an opinionated control plane: predictable, observable, and elegant. Documentation should:

- Convey a clear mental model: *core* powers data + APIs, *web* delivers user journeys, *console* is operational control, and *agents* automate workloads.
- Keep platform shape stable across versions using shared patterns and env var conventions.
- Provide fast onboarding with runnable examples and checklists.

> TODO: Align this vision statement with the latest product narrative and branding language from GTM.
