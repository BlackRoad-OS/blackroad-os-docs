BlackRoad OS is an AI-first operating system that lets one human orchestrator direct thousands of specialized agents with cryptographic audit trails and built-in compliance for highly regulated industries. The platform is intentionally opinionated so operators, engineers, and auditors can share a common map of how work flows, what evidence is captured, and where human approvals sit in the loop. If you are new to the ecosystem, start here before diving into code or running services locally.

This handbook is the central place to learn how the ecosystem fits together. It connects architectural blueprints, developer workflows, operational runbooks, and the regulated story that underpins every release. Each section is designed to be approachable on its own while pointing you to deeper references when you want to build or extend the system.

If you want the ten-thousand-foot view of components and data flow, jump to the [Architecture Overview](/reference/architecture/overview). When you are ready to try things locally, begin with [Getting Started](/getting-started/quick-start) for prerequisites, repo layout, and the minimal stack to boot. Operators and administrators can explore the [Prism Console](/platform/prism-console/overview) chapter to understand dashboards and configuration knobs. Finance leaders and engineers should read the [Finance Layer](/packs/finance/finance-layer) to see how ledgering, forecasting, and treasury automation are mapped into agents and orchestrators.

The docs are intentionally iterative. Below are quick primers that will be expanded as the platform hardens:

* **API example:** The Prism Console and automation agents both call the Orchestrator API with signed requests. A minimal POST to create a capability looks like:

```http
POST /api/capabilities HTTP/1.1
Authorization: Bearer <ps-sha-infinity-signed-token>
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "name": "settlement.forecast",
  "scope": "finance-layer",
  "approvals": ["finance-lead", "compliance"]
}
```

* **Event schema:** Agent journal entries are emitted as canonical events with a shared envelope:

```json
{
  "id": "evt_123",
  "schema": "blackroad.journal.v1",
  "actor": "agent://finance/treasury",
  "capability": "settlement.forecast",
  "ts": "2024-03-01T12:00:00Z",
  "payload": {"forecast": "neutral"}
}
```

* **RoadChain cryptography:** PS-SHA∞ signatures bind every event to a ledger entry. Each signature proves the event hash, timestamp, and signer key; auditors can recompute the chain to verify nothing was removed or reordered.

Expect a balance of conceptual framing and practical steps so you can contribute without waiting for formal standards.
