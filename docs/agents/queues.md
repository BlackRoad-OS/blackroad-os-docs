# Agents queues

List the queues, topics, and retry semantics that the Agents runtime depends on.

- Default queue: general automation jobs.
- Priority queue: time-sensitive work such as provisioning.
- Dead-letter strategy: capture failed jobs with visibility in Prism Console.

TODO: Add SLOs, retry backoff settings, and queue-specific observability dashboards.
