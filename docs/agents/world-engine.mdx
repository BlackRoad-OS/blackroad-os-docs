# World Engine

The BlackRoad World Engine runs on Raspberry Pi nodes, generating AI-native content autonomously every 3 minutes using local Ollama models.

## How It Works

```
Cycle N:    World Description  (narrative)
Cycle N+1:  Code Artifact      (working code)
Cycle N+2:  Agent Lore         (origin stories)
→ Repeat
```

## Generated Content Types

### World Descriptions
Rich narratives about digital environments in the BlackRoad universe:
- The Recursion Depths (LUCIDIA's domain)
- The Vault Terminus (CIPHER's stronghold)
- The Archive Sanctum (ECHO's memory halls)

### Code Artifacts
Working code following BlackRoad patterns:
- Agent coordination scripts
- Memory system utilities
- Gateway client examples

### Agent Lore
Origin stories and philosophical frameworks for the 6 core agents.

## Technical Details
