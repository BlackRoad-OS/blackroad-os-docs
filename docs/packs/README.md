## What is a Pack?

A Pack is a curated collection of agents, policies, and workflow definitions scoped to a specific business domain. Packs are:

- **Composable** — deploy alongside any other pack without conflicts
- **Policy-aware** — ship with governance rules aligned to their domain
- **Observable** — surface metrics natively in Prism Console

## Pricing

Packs are available on **Pro** and **Enterprise** plans. See [Pricing & Stripe Integration](../../README.md#pricing--stripe-integration) in the root README.
