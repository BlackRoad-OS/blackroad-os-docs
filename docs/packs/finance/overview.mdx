The Finance pack bundles treasury, invoicing, and reconciliation agents that speak the same PS-SHA∞ evidence language. It aligns with CFO and audit expectations while remaining composable.

## Core personas

- **Treasury coordinator** — reconciles cash positions, generates liquidity alerts, and triggers compliance checks.
- **Billing agent** — issues invoices, tracks receipts, and posts updates to RoadChain for downstream reporting.
- **Risk analyst** — watches event streams for anomalies and routes incidents to humans.

## Operating guidance

- Deploy alongside `blackroad-os-operator` to keep finance jobs near the event bus.
- Surface pack metrics in Prism Console using the Finance dashboards.
- Keep secrets and API tokens in your vault; bind them to agents via environment variables at runtime.

## Extending the pack

1. Add new finance agents to `agent-catalog/agents.yaml` with `pack: finance`.
2. Include policies in `docs/governance-policy` when they impact approvals or segregation of duties.
3. Update this overview with links to the generated agent pages.
