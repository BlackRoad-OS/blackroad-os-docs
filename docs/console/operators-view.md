# Operators view

Document the Prism Console experience for operators: queues, audit trails, and escalation flows.

- Home: operational dashboard for current tenants.
- Actions: pause/resume agents, review job histories, and triage alerts.
- URLs: prefer `CONSOLE_URL` from `src/config/docsConfig.js` when linking out.

TODO: Add screenshots and end-to-end runbooks for incident workflows.
