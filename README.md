## What is BlackRoad OS?

BlackRoad OS is a **governance and orchestration platform** for AI agents. It provides:

- **Governance Layer** — Policies, audit trails, and permission management for AI operations
- **Agent Orchestration** — Coordinate multiple AI agents across tools and workflows
- **Six Portals** — Integrated experiences for personal AI, education, media, gaming, navigation, and privacy

### Core Components

|-----------|---------|
| **Cece** | Lucidia-class governance agent — the brain of BlackRoad |
| **Policies** | Rules that allow, deny, or modify AI actions |
| **Ledger** | Immutable audit trail of all governance events |
| **Intents** | Task and workflow state management |
| **Claims & Delegations** | Identity and permission management |

## Contributing

Keep content concise, link across sections, and prefer iterative updates over monolithic rewrites. Mark components as `planned`, `alpha`, or `in-flight` when appropriate so operators, developers, and partners have an honest view of the system.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for style conventions, validation steps, and how to extend the sidebar when adding new pages.
