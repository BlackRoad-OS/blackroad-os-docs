# BlackRoad OS Docs

This repository powers the BlackRoad OS documentation site built with **Docusaurus v2**. It is the central hub for architecture, agents, finance automation, infrastructure, developer workflows, and compliance guidance.

## Running the docs locally

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

The dev server runs at http://localhost:3000.

## Building for production

```bash
npm run build
npm run serve
```

`npm run serve` serves the static build locally for validation.

## Where to start

- [Introduction](docs/intro.md) – welcome and quick orientation.
- [Architecture Overview](docs/architecture/overview.md) – how services fit together.
- [Finance Layer](docs/architecture/finance-layer.md) – catalog of finance agents and their responsibilities.

Contributions are welcome. Keep content concise, link across sections, and add TODOs where deeper technical details will follow.
